# his-hapi-jwt

The example demonstrates a basic implementation of a REST API that needs a JWT token to access. It covers some details on how to create a JWT and validate. It is certainly not production not ready code but can be used to demonstrate the power of hapi to build secure APIs. Further the sample shows how to package into a Docker that can be run on any Docker runtime or deployed to Kubernetes.
